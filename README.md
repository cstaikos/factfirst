# Truthometer
> Billions of conversations occur online every day. Despite this volume, they can be surprisingly unproductive, as it's all too easy to propagate false information. Often it's accidental, sometimes it's intentional, but it's always detrimental to constructive discourse. Truthometer enables truth to unfold via a collaborative user-driven process of evidence collection and verification. In many ways, it is a social experiment to see whether crowd sourced fact-checking is viable.

This project was built by Chris, Filip, Matthew and Steve for our Bitmaker final assignment. For upcoming features and to get a glimpse of the development process please check out our public <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1545365">Pivotal Tracker</a>.
