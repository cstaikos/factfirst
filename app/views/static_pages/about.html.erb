<h1>Truthometer</h1>

<h3>A True Problem</h3>
<p>
  Billions of conversations occur online every day. Despite this volume, they can be surprisingly unproductive. One part of the problem is that it's all too easy to propogate false information. Often it's accidental, sometimes it's intentional, but it's always detrimental to constructive discourse.

<h3>A Collaborative Solution</h3>
<p>
  Truthometer enables truth to unfold via a collaborative process of evidence collection and verification. A fact's standing should be evaluated solely on the quality of the evidence supporting or refuting it.

    <em>I believe in evidence. I believe in observation, measurement, and reasoning, confirmed by independent observers. I'll believe anything, no matter how wild and ridiculous, if there is evidence for it. The wilder and more ridiculous something is, however, the firmer and more solid the evidence will have to be.</em>

<h3>A Fact Repository, Accessible Anywhere</h3>
<p>
  Facts on Truthometer can be shared easily across the web. Each fact has an auto-generated image representing its truth score and other stats. Simply drop this into a conversation in your favorite forum or social network and set the record straight! Images also include a link back to Truthometer - if others in the conversation disagree, it's on them to contribute evidence to support their view.
